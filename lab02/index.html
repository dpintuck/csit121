    <article><p>So far, I have found HTML easier than I thought.  
        The toughest part for me is starting.  
        I procrastinate too much.  Once I get started, it doesn’t take long for me to complete the labs.

        You just must make sure you have all the bullets in the right order.</p>
    <h3>What I have learned:</h3>
