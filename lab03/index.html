                <p> So far, I have found HTML easier than I thought.  
                    The toughest part for me is starting.  
                    I procrastinate too much.  Once I get started, 
                    it doesn’t take long for me to complete the labs.  
                    I find it helpful just to consider it a bulleted list.  
                    You just must make sure you have all the bullets in the right order.</p>
                <h3>What I have learned:</h3>
                <ol><li>To just start and don't keep putting it off</li>
                <li>This is not as complicated as it looks.  Its just a bulleted list.</li></ol>

                <p>I will be honest, this module was more than slightly overwhelming this week.  
                    I think it was just the amount of information that was coming at me.  
                    The class meeting on Thursday helped me realize that I did not need to 
                    know everything all at once, and explained some of the parts I was not understanding.  
                    The best was the chart you showed that explained the difference between margin, 
                    border, and padding.  I also realized that I do not need to use <span id="all">ALL</span> the properties.  
                    If there was something I really didn't get I googled it.</p>
